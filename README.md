# Odin Recipes

This project is for practicing HTML and as the first project for the Odin Project. I'm actually experienced with web design using HTML, but I need to practice again and start from the basics to improve my base and also improve this project after learning more. Right now this is only a website with some food recipes.

# Skills

Through making this project I take a new look to my HTML basics, such as different tags (anchors, headings, images, etc) as well as improving my knowledge of the web basics.
